**Timely Diagnosis of Retinal Diseases can be Treated**

The retina is a layer of tissue in the back of the eye, which helps to sense light and sends images to the brain. Retina’s centre part is known as the macula. The macula allows one to see the sharp, clear images which are needed for reading, driving and seeing fine details. A healthy retina is essential for good and clear vision.

**Below are the different types of Retinal Diseases:**

**Retinal Tears:** Tears can form in the retina, leading to retinal detachment and severe loss of vision.<br>
**Retinal Detachment:** A retinal detachment is an emergency that can cause permanent vision loss, if not treated promptly.<br>
**Diabetic Retinopathy:** If you are suffering from Diabetes, then the tiny vessels of blood supplying the retina can get damaged and leak fluid into the retina. This causes swelling of the retina, known as macular oedema, which can damage your retina and impair vision. High blood sugar can also lead to bleeding inside the eye.<br>
**Epiretinal membrane:** Epiretinal Membrane is a type of abnormal layer formed above the retina which leads to blurred and distorted vision<br>
**Macular hole:** A hole formed in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye is called the macular hole.<br>

**Age-related Macular degeneration: In this condition, with ageing, the centre of our retina starts getting damaged. Due to this, blurring of vision is the main symptom.**

**Retinitis pigmentosa:** This is a rare, and inherited degenerative eye disease. Symptoms include the loss of night and side vision.

**Here are a few symptoms which can be detected for Retinal Disease. Mostly, Retinal Diseases share common symptoms.**<br>
**For Example:**<br>

• Loss of vision <br>
• Distortion of vision <br>
• Inability to see in dim light.<br>
• Impaired colour vision<br>

There are some common causes of Retinal Diseases eg. Ageing, Diabetes/High Blood Pressure, High power of glasses, Problems with Blood Vessels, Side Effects of any medicine, Genetics, Tumors in the eye, Holes in the macula, Due to radiation, and Eye Injury. If you’re suffering from any of the above problems, without a delay you should consult an ophthalmologist. She also added, that to detect this vision problem, below are several necessary vision tests which will help us to detect it:

1. Amsler grid test
2. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) 
3. Fundus auto fluorescence (FAF)
4. Fluorescein angiography.
5. Indocyanine green angiography
6. Ultrasound

**Here are some of the treatment modalities which can be undertaken for retinal diseases include:**

• Laser photocoagulation <br>
• Injecting medicines into the eye (intravitreal injections)<br>
• Surgery<br>
• Radiation therapy for tumours<br>
